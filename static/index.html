        <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
        <p>A platform which enables home cooks to sell extra dinner portions to customers in their local area. The app needs to help users to browse, book and pay for meals</p>
        <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>Developed a React-Express web-app which can search meals by date & distance, allows users to create an account, read cook reviews and book meals</p>
        <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>The platform is currently incomplete. The customer user journey MVP is complete, however a seperate portal for cooks is required</p>

      <div>
        <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
        <p>I had an interest in cryptocurrencies and wanted to build a trading bot to make use of the nascent peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending market.
          The bot needed to autonomously lend cryptocurrency at optimal interest rates, using small volumes of currency</p>
        <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>Developed a Python application which ran on Amazon's AWS EC2 & RDS to track and store interest rates, calculate optimal time and price at which to provide loans and execute loans without my interaction. The most difficult challenges were in developing the mathematical logic for deciding time & price to execute
          and ensuring loan interest rates remained optimal in the event of API connection failures</p>
        <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>The bot worked well, achieved >20% interest on an annual basis (bitcoin interest rates tend to be high). Given more time and experience I would like to refactor the code, expand testing coverage and improve the interest rate achieved e.g. by using neural networks to calculate ideal trading parameters</p>

      <div>
        <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
        <p>I became interested in card counting and finding the best counting methods possible.
        I wanted to test several theories in practice to understand how they would impact a payer's edge over the dealer</p>
        <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>Developed a blackjack simulator in python which would play out thousands of games under different game conditions,
          using different card counting strategies.
          Confirmed several theories about scenarios which will give you a better edge when counting</p>
        <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>Given more time I would like to build an ultimate card counting programme which would be
          able to know the exact probability of winning or losing the next hand based on the exact card left in the deck</p>
