    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>My name is Denis Kent. I have an academic background in Molecular Biochemistry and professional experience in consulting. Most recently I worked as a data analyst and strategy consultant advising on small-medium sized company acquisitions. While working I became  interested in coding, largely due to my enjoyment of solving logical problems.</p>

    <p>Having learnt Python and Visual Basic while working on projects in my spare evenings I decided to take part in a selective coding bootcamp, Founders and Coders. The bootcamp enabled me to work on my programming skills full-time while also providing a rounded skill set in preparation for entering the industry.</p>

  <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>

      <h3><span>Cryptocurrency Lending Bot</span><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DenisKent/CryptoCurrencyLendingBot"><img class = "git-project-link" src="images/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" alt="Link to github" title="GitHub project"></a></h3>

      <div>
        <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
        <p>I had interest in cryptocurrencies and wanted to build a trading bot to make use of the nascent peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending market.
          The bot had to autonomously lend cryptocurrency at optimal interest rates, using small amounts of currency - this was my first time trading.</p>
        <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>Developed a Python application which ran 24/7 on Amazon's AWS EC2 & RDS to track and store interest rates,
          calculate optimal time and price at which to provide loans and execute loans without my interaction.
          The most difficult challenges were in developing the mathematical logic for deciding time & price to execute
          and ensuring loan interest rates remained optimal in the event of API connection failures.</p>
        <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>System worked well, achieved >20% interest on an annual basis (bitcoin interest rates tend to be high). Given more time and experience I would like
          to strengthen the system e.g. use neural networks to calculate ideal trading parameters or develop the capability to trade currency rather than
           lend in specific scenarios.</p>

          <h3>BlackJack Card Counting Simulator<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DenisKent/BlackJackSimulator"><img class = "git-project-link" src="images/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" alt="Link to github" title="GitHub project"></a></h3>
          <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
          <p>I became interested in card counting and finding the best counting methods possible.
          I wanted to test several theories in practice to understand how they would impact a payer's edge over the dealer.</p>
          <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
          <p>Developed a blackjack simulator which would play out thousands of games under different game conditions,
            using different card counting strategies.
            Confirmed several theories about scenarios which will give you a better edge when counting.</p>
          <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
          <p>Given more time I would like to build the ultimate card counting programme which would be
            able to know the exact probability of winning or losing the next hand based on the exact card left in the deck.
          Connecting this to an image recognition system would be handy too!</p>
