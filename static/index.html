    <h2 class = "section-title">ABOUT</h2>
    <p>My name is Denis Kent. I have an academic background in Molecular Biochemistry and professional experience in consulting.
      Currently I work as data analyst and strategy consultant advising on small-medium sized company acquisitions.
      Over the past years I have become interested in coding, largely due to the enjoyment of solving logical problems.</p>

    <p>Having learnt Python and Visual basic in my spare evenings, I have tried to incorporate coding into my role,
      but there have been few opportunities to do so. In order to further my learning I began work on passion projects
      (see <a href="#portfolio">portfolio</a>). These developed my language capabilities (Python, VBA, C++),
      helped me to understand the complexities of developing larger applications and introduced me to basic practicalities of database management and APIâ€™s.</p>

    <p>Following this passion will require a transition in to the tech industry.
      The Founders and Coders bootcamp is ideally structured to provide this.
      Focusing purely on improving skills through pair programming and regular team
      workshops helps students learn rapidly while also enabling them to experience larger, more
      complex projects. Founders and Coders recruiting partner relationships also provide opportunities to enter the workforce quickly.</p>

    <p>Having met some of the current students, I was pleasantly surprised how patient and
      helpful they were, spending their evenings helping people during workshops.
      This highlighted to me the environment that students were studying in and the values they have,
      which I share. I am also attracted by the accessibility of the course. I think it is admirable
      that it enables people to follow their passion in coding irrespective of their background.
      The mentoring system in place and the pro bono work done for local businesses/non-profits creates a culture of giving back.</p>

    <p>Thank you for considering me.</p>

      <h3>Cryptocurrency Lending Bot<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DenisKent/CryptoCurrencyLendingBot"><img class = "git-project-link" src="images/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" alt="Link to github" title="GitHub project"></a></h3>
      <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
      <p>I had interest in cryptocurrencies and wanted to build a trading bot to make use of the nascent peer-to-peer cryptocurrency lending market.
        The bot had to autonomously lend cryptocurrency at optimal interest rates, using small amounts of currency - this was my first time trading.</p>
      <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
      <p>Developed a Python application which ran 24/7 on Amazon's AWS EC2 & RDS to track and store interest rates,
        calculate optimal time and price at which to provide loans and execute loans without my interaction.
        The most difficult challenges were in developing the mathematical logic for deciding time & price to execute
        and ensuring loan interest rates remained optimal in the event of API connection failures.</p>
      <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
      <p>System worked well, achieved >20% interest on an annual basis (bitcoin interest rates tend to be high). Given more time and experience I would like
        to strengthen the system e.g. use neural networks to calculate ideal trading parameters or develop the capability to trade currency rather than
         lend in specific scenarios.</p>

        <h3>BlackJack Card Counting Simulator<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DenisKent/BlackJackSimulator"><img class = "git-project-link" src="images/GitHub-Mark-120px-plus.png" alt="Link to github" title="GitHub project"></a></h3>
        <h4 style="color: #4169E1;">GOAL</h4>
        <p>I became interested in card counting and finding the best counting methods possible.
        I wanted to test several theories in practice to understand how they would impact a payer's edge over the dealer.</p>
        <h4 style="color: #20B2AA;">SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>Developed a blackjack simulator which would play out thousands of games under different game conditions,
          using different card counting strategies.
          Confirmed several theories about scenarios which will give you a better edge when counting.</p>
        <h4 style="color: #6A5ACD;">WHAT'S NEXT?</h4>
        <p>Given more time I would like to build the ultimate card counting programme which would be
          able to know the exact probability of winning or losing the next hand based on the exact card left in the deck.
        Connecting this to an image recognition system would be handy too!</p>
